# Lausanne public transportation network

This GitHub repository presents the results of a university thesis on the Lausanne 2024 transportation network, including a sorted GTFS dataset, modeling illustrations, and identified errors, aiming to enhance transportation simulation and planning.

## Data

The data consist of 10 text files. These files collectively form a GTFS feed that was used for importing into the PTV VISSIM simulation software.

### Sources

The data were sourced from the [opentransportdata platform](https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/group), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), and [viageo](https://viageo.ch/).

### Organisation 

The data are structured according to the layout illustrated in the image below.
