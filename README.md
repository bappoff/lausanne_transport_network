## Data 

### Sources

The COVID-19 statistics used in this project comes from [https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). It is a publicly available dataset that is updated daily by [Our World Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). The provide relevant informations about the pandemic such as *reproduction rate*, *vaccination*, *policy responses* and more. We choose to focus on two of those, **confirmed cases** and **confirmed deaths**. 

The basemap used is [World Terrain Base](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c61ad8ab017d49e1a82f580ee1298931) from ERSI. 

The coutries layer is a [geoJSON file ](https://github.com/leakyMirror/map-of-europe), modified to only keep European countries. 

### Organisation 

All the information is in the geoJSON file. After deleting coutries outside of Europe, the COVID-19 statistics were added directly in the file, so they are directly available when a coutry is selected. 

## Functionnalities

Here are the different ways users can interact with the map: 

- move the map with the mouse by click-and-drag, zoom in and out
- see what coutry the mouse is hovering on in the top right side of the map box
- select a country:
	- either by clicking on it
	- or by search for it with the serach box on the left
- switch between cases and deaths to see the corresponding barplot
- hover on the bars to highlight a particular month
- Reset everything with a button
